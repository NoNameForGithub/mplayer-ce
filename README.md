MPlayer CE is a homebrew media player for the Nintendo Wii. It was initially created as a fork of Team Twiizers' port of MPlayer, combining elements of MPlayerWii, GeeXboX and other great homebrew contributions. It is built with devkitPro and not associated with Nintendo in any way.

Some of the current features includes DVD, SDHC, SMB, USB 2.0 storage device support, multiple media, subtitle, playlist and streaming formats, customization possibilities, etc.
