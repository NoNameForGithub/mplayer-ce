MPlayer CE is an unofficial  port of the  very popular multimedia  player for
various  platforms  including  Windows  and  Linux.  This  Nintendo Wii  port 
features the same compatibility that the other versions offer, but is limited
in some aspects  as it can't playback  some high resolution videos due to the
processing power of the Wii.

MPlayer CE will  allow you to  watch various  movies in different  formats on 
your  Nintendo Wii  including AVI,  DIVX,  XVID,  MPEG2  and  DVD  Videos. It 
actually supports a huge  range of formats  and can playback media from DVDs,
SD Cards, USB drives  and over your local  area  network  using  Samba  (SMB)
shares. MPlayer CE also  allows  you  to  listen  to  radio  streams over the 
Internet.

This port is  based on the original work of  Team Twiizer's  MPlayer Wii port 
and uses code from [rOn]'s  MPlayer Wii port along with code from GeeXbox. It 
is currently  maintained by Scip, tipolosko, rodries, AgentX & DJDynamite123.

While there are  numerous ports and versions  of MPlayer for the Nintendo Wii 
its hard to  tell which  one to use, but  this one is being heavily developed 
and surpases  the other versions  due to its  performance, optimizations  and 
features.

To run MPlayer CE you'll need a Nintendo Wii that has been "soft modded" with
either  the  Homebrew  Channel,  Homebrew  Launcher  or LoadMii.  The archive  
contains a folder  named "MPlayer_ce"  which  you will  need  to copy to your
"apps" folder  on your SD Card. 
Once  copied  over you  can launch it  using the  loader of your choice.

For  USB 2.0  support  you  will  need  to install the USB 2.0 cIOS from here
(please note that this requires an internet connection): 

   http://mplayer-ce.googlecode.com/files/cIOS_Installer.rar

Make sure to watch it download and install in case it fails and returns to HBC.
Those that install this cIOS do not require DVDx.

Offline installation is available.  For a guide please see here:

   http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/showthread.php?p=62838

If you receive the error codes -1017 or -2011 your Wii probably does not have
an  IOS  with the  fakesigning bug.  Users without  the  fakesign  bug cannot
install this cIOS. Trucha Bug Restorer is an  application to workaround this.
It is  compatible  with  all  Wiis and  up to  system menu 4.1. Only use this
program if you have an idea what the trucha bug

   http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Signing_bug

is and why you need it. For more information and to download visit:

   http://www.tehskeen.com/viewarticle.php?articleid=4295

Once complete, download the cIOS Installer and choose IOS36 as the IOS in the
selection screen.
Make sure to watch it download and install in case it fails and returns to HBC.

If you plan on updating make sure to install the cIOS and DVDx before updating.

In the "MPlayer_ce" folder you copied over to your SD card you will find some
.conf files  which can  alter the way  MPlayer operates  and is also  used to 
setup your SMB shares. MPlayer CE has  the ability to use  five different SMB
shares, but they  must be configured manually by editing the "smb.conf" file.
Inside of  it you'll find  five different  entries.  You can  fill in as many 
shares as you like. The format is as follows:

#Samba share1  (smb1:/)
ip1=192.168.0.1
share1=Movies
user1=Test
pass1=fr0g

The "ip1" is your  computer's  IP address,  the "share1"  is the name of your 
shared folder, "user1" is the  username you use to login to your computer and
lastly "pass1" is your password  you use to login to your computer. If you do
not use a username and password,  leave  user1  and  pass1  blank,  "user1=",
"pass1=" so MPlayer CE knows not to use a password to login to your SMB share.

If your share folder has a space in it, you must surround  it  with quotation
marks: share1="My Movies".

You can also force the aspect ratio of  the screen. This means that all video
files will be displayed at the specified ratio.  To force 16/9 you will  need
to edit the "mplayer.conf" file and add the following line:

"ratio=1.7778" (add it without the quotes)

Lastly, if you wish to change the  background image you can create  your own.
After creating a custom background  (it can be a still image or an animation)
convert it to a video, name it "loop.avi" and place it  in  the  "MPlayer_ce"
folder.  The specifications for "loop.avi" are listed below.

XVID MPEG4 Compressed AVI
640x456 or 720x480 Resolution

How to change colour of subtitles?

to change colour of subs you need to add some params to your'e mplayer.conf
e.g. with this param now subs are yellow
ass=yes
ass-font-scale=2.2
ass-color=FFFF0000
ass-font-scale to change subs size

The Nintendo Wii is capable of reading DVD DATA and DVD-VIDEO discs, but this
functionality  while  left  into  the  Nintendo  Wii  needs  to be enabled by 
installing  DVDx from  Team Twiizers.  If you use USB2 and have installed the 
cIOS202 then you don't need a DVDx install at all, as the cIOS has a patch to 
access DVD without it.
You  can  locate  DVDx  from  the URLs below.  
Make sure to install  the  correct version as there is one for System Menu 
3.2/3.3  3.4  and 4.0

     later date.  Thanks to Hermes for the patch.
   * Finally fixed the problem with network and USB 2.0 conflicts
     (due to the driver using a bad device).
   * Font loading improved.
   * Improved MPlayer support when a file unexpectedly disappears and reappears.
   * Many other small fixes and code cleanup.
   * New USB test:
      - If http://mplayer-ce.googlecode.com/files/USB%20Test.rar says USB device
        is compatible but a device is not working then there is no FAT partition
        on the device.  Check if you are using NTFS or exFAT instead.

   * Use small cache if opening an internet stream (audio and video).
   * Optimized memory access (thanks to a suggestion from Shagkur); cache thread
     is now more stable.

     modchips.
   * Improved Libfat:
      - fix for special characters
      - prevent possible corruption on sd
      - can now mount any FAT partition, whether primary or active

   * ECHI module modified for greater compatibility with USB devices.

     shown on OSD level 3.

     menu.conf.
